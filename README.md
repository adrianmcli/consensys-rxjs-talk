# consensys-rxjs-talk
Example project for my RxJS talk w/ ConsenSys (along w/ a Drizzle-Utils demo)

## How to run

1. At project root, run `truffle develop` and then run `migrate` in the Truffle develop prompt to compile and migrate the contract. Run the `test` command to confirm smart contract works as intended.

2. In a separate terminal, navigate into the `app` directory for the React frontend. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

3. Open a browser (where MetaMask is disabled, e.g. incognito mode) and navigate to `http://localhost:1234/`.
